# Roman Numbers Kata

We are going to create a function that converts arabic numbers into roman numerals.

## Precept

We're working as a pair. The one who writes the code is the driver, the other is called navigator. After a certain amount of time (~5-7 mins) we switch roles. The driver decides what's written, but the navigator can consult. The driver can always ask the navigator what to do next. The navigator should only talk when asked or if a rule is broken.

## Rules (Baby Steps)

- We add no new functionality without a failing test
- We write the minimal code to make the test pass
- We don't refactor if tests aren't green

## Conversion

I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
